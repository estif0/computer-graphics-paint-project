# 🎨 Computer Graphics Paint Project

Welcome to the Computer Graphics Paint Project! This application is designed to provide an accessible and intuitive platform for users to create and manipulate digital drawings using core graphics concepts and algorithms.

## ✨ Features

- **🖊️ Line Drawing**: Implemented using the Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) algorithm for precise and smooth lines.
- **📐 Shape Drawing**: Supports drawing circles, rectangles, and triangles using efficient algorithms.
- **🖌️ Brush and Eraser Tools**: Allows freehand drawing and erasing with adjustable stroke width and color.
- **🔲 Grid Overlay**: Optional grid overlay to assist with alignment and precision.
- **↩️ Undo/Redo Functionality**: Easily revert or reapply changes to your drawing.
- **🎨 Color Picker**: Choose and apply colors with a user-friendly color picker and history.

## ♿ Accessibility

This project is built with accessibility in mind, ensuring that users of all abilities can interact with the application effectively. The interface is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate, with clear visual cues and responsive controls. In addition, it supports both Amharic, Affan-Oromo, and English languages.

## 📚 Core Graphics Concepts

The project demonstrates the implementation of fundamental graphics algorithms, including:

- **📏 Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA)**: For line drawing.
- **⭕ Midpoint Circle Algorithm**: For drawing circles.
- **🔺 Rectangle and Triangle Drawing**: Using computer graphics geometric principles.
